	    <h2>Introduction</h2>
	    <p>I think I’m on my second or third year of saying that I’m going to write more but instead, deciding to play fighting games. I think there’s some context that could be shed about that underlying habit, however, I think it would be far more beneficiary to just put pen to paper rather than wax poetic. Twenty Twenty-One wasn’t the same nightmare as the previous year, but in some ways, I would call it worse. Like always, I feel some level of survivor’s guilt by having some of the most stable years of my life while others are barely getting by.  I’ve managed to level myself out with new meds and a better therapist, but time will tell how long this all sticks together. The more I think about how things have been going, the more I think it’s important to just throw myself at everything important to me and let God sort out this rest. I’m going to make the hardest segue way possible now, so I apologize for the whiplash. I’m doing my best to not make this an essay about coping with our current lives, despite how that is ABSOLUTELY going to factor into the things I talk about. With that said, I’d like to talk about some games that really left an impression on me this year.</p>

	 <section class="sc1">
	   <h2>Melty Blood: Type Lumina</h2>
	     <p>First on the list is Melty Blood: Type Lumina. I realize that most of my lists have either had Street Fighter V or Granblue on them for multiple years, but the announcement of this game felt like we’d finally crossed the threshold into whatever alternate dimension we’d been colliding with for some time. Melty Blood Actress Again Current Code has long been a stable in the fighting game community for a multitude of reasons. It’s hard to imagine, but looking at MBAACC, you wouldn’t think that a ten-year-old game based off a Type Moon visual novel would be one of the most accessible fighting games in the post-pandemic world, but lo and behold. Despite some actual mechanical complexity, MBAACC was extremely accessible between the excellent net code and specs that allow it to run on just about any machine you could download it on. This level of accessibility feels like template that its’ successor, Type Lumina, was built upon.</p>
		 <img class="picture" src="images/kouma.jpg" alt="Melty Blood: Type Lumina"> 
		 <p>Type Lumina is the definition of low skill floor, high skill ceiling. The basic tutorial and character trials give you all you need to jump into the game. Each character’s move list has been simplified from the previous iteration and all characters have a unified basic combo route to get players started with. It’s rare to see a game that lets someone feel like they aren’t just flailing around as someone beats on them early on, but Melty manages to pull it off. The sprite design and general aesthetic of the game fall into the same cozy feeling associated with older FGs while managing to keep a modern flourish with just how intricate and expressive these sprites are. Of note, I think the reworked moon system is an interesting way to merge three variations of characters into a single functioning unit.</p>
		 <p>Despite how much I personally enjoyed the game, it isn’t without gripes. At the time of writing, it is hard to find matches without interacting with a community discord. I personally don’t mind this, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss being able to boot up and hop in queue a bit before work. Second, I think that some of the systems in the game are a bit half baked. The auto combo system is extremely restrictive. I had multiple issue trying to dial out bread and butter combos because the game detected my double taps as an auto combo. The shield system doesn’t necessarily feel rewarding, so much as it feels like if you aren’t rotating two to three option selects, then you are asking for trouble. Lastly, the initial launch of the game left some things to be desired. The net code was good, but various bugs detracted from what should have been a slam dunk. All in all, I really enjoyed Type Lumina and I wish it was still as accessible to play as both its predecessor and its contemporaries.</p>

	  <h2>Neo: The World Ends With You</h2>
	     <p>Much like Type Lumina, it’s astonishing to me that this game even exists. The World Ends with You was a weirdo DS game and one of the most niche JRPGs on the market. When they announced a sequel, I was honestly in shock. After a certain point, I’ve conditioned myself to accept that any modern revival of a cult classic is either relegated to a poorly made port or mobile spin-off, both of which TWEWY has seen. Neo: The World Ends with You is both a sequel as well as a reinvention of the franchise. While the general moment to moment storytelling is untouched, the battle system is redesigned from the ground up in a way that justifies the move from handheld. Instead of individual powers per button, now players interact with different characters per power per button. All your party members have specializations the excel in, but the ability to mix and match them as well as each member having their own set of stats adds depth to the combat system.</p>
	     <p>One thing that really made the original game stand out were the characters and the aesthetic direction the game uses to tell their stories. Shibuya is just as interesting to run around in now as it was in the previous game, but the 3D rendering manages to keep some of the aesthetic flourish that made the prequel so charming. The new cast additions are all excellent, especially local fujoshi, Nagi. Obsessed with what seems to be a normal J Drama/Gatcha, Nagi manages to be your parties’ heavy hitter and strongest magic user while living entirely in her own, nonsensical world. She has multiple flashbacks that evoke a Rose of Versailles panel which is a huge plus in my book. The story deals with the idea of inaction and a fear of moving forward, both of which speak to me on a personal level.</p>
	     <p>My biggest regret with this game is that I haven’t finished it, thus I cannot really give a definitive ranking or vote of confidence. I’ve dropped about 20 hours into the game, but my plans of finishing it before the year was up got knee capped by SMT V. It’s on my list of things to knock out in the new year, but alas, time makes fools of us all.</p>

	  <h2>The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel</h2>
	    <p>The next major game I played was The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel and despite years of shitposting about Trails games, I came away from Cold Steel a believer. To put it bluntly, Cold Steel is a dated game and was already dated when it dropped on the PlayStation 3. The system mechanics have a fair bit of nuance to them, especially if you enjoy breaking systems open, but nothing is particularly new or revolutionary. It’s not to say that these systems are bad, but they don’t make up the special sauce that makes a JRPG enticing. Cold Steel manages to set itself apart with the sheer depth in the characters and setting.</p>
		<img class="picture" src="images/coldsteel.jpg" alt="The Legend of Heroes: Cold Steel"> 
	    <p>Cold Steel portrays itself as a Persona knock-off but calling it that is a bit disingenuous. Characters are initially presented with the same anime cliches you’d see in the traditional Persona character but spending any time with them reveals layers of nuance and depth. Each of your party members has their own arc throughout the story separate from your one on ones with them. These stories are used to flesh out your ragtag group of misfits as well as the geopolitical areas they come from. Each of your party members represents a certain faction amongst the competing empires, and as such, exploring their lives means exploring their homelands. Each of these regions are fleshed through your character’s daily studies as well as by talking to both your party members as well as the citizens. Nihon Falcom goes so far out of their way to give players depth to sink their teeth into while also allowing less invested players to keep up as well. After finishing Cold Steel, I really thought I’d had my fill but I’ve been thinking about the game more and more lately as I progress in other RPGs. I’m really thankful for the time I spent in Erebonia and I cannot wait to go back.</p>

	  	<h2>Adios</h2>
	      <p>As we move on, the next few games are what I’d consider my game of the year contenders. I don’t plan on talking about every single game on my list, but I’ll leave a full list at the bottom for those who are interested. With that said, I want to talk about Adios by not talking about it in detail. Adios takes about two hours to complete and costs as much as a nice pizza, but what you get in return is so much more. Adios is told by a series of vignettes, but each of them is written with the same care and consistency that most novels aspire too. Adios is the story of a man walking away from his past and trying to explain anymore would ruin the experience. I’m sorry I cannot sit here and tell you more, but Adios is worth your time and it’s arguably one of the best written and acted games I’ve ever played.</p>

	  <h2>Metroid Dread</h2>
	    <p>Up next would-be Metroid Dread, but I’m also at a similar loss for words. I don’t think that anything Dread does is particularly revolutionary or genre defining, but it’s absolutely a best in class showing from the Mercury Steam development team. Every single mechanic is finely tuned to a science and these mechanics are refined in both movement and in your boss battles. The game has an incredibly high skill ceiling, but it manages to make basic movement and ability use extremely satisfying. At a certain point, the player is moving at mach speed as they tear through every single enemy in their path. Every jump, every shot and every missile during this momentum feels incredible. It’s the level of high-speed combat and flexibility that I normally associate with fighting games which makes sense considering how well programmed the one-on-one boss encounters are.</p>
		<p>Each fight has a specific rhythm and logic to it. Each confrontation is a new lesson learned, especially considering the level of difficulty associated with each boss. You are expected to die multiple times against these bosses, but once you’ve learned their mechanics, the final encounters are usually flawless. The game teaches you to understand every little interaction the boss has and counter them accordingly. By learning the specific rhythms and patterns, you also learn to adapt to your environment. There were multiple enemies with similar attacks to these bosses that made sure the lessons taught in boss encounters stuck. Dread manages to train the player and hone their skillset in ways that are wholly unique and should be encouraged going forward. I’m excited for whatever Mercury Steam’s next endeavor is, no matter how long it takes for us to see it.</p>
