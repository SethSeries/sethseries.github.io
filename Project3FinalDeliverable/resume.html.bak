	     <p><strong>Remote Support Restructure Project</strong></p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Tasked with creating canned responses for the LogMeIn remote support program so unify the voice of our department towards front facing clients.</li>
			<li>The first step for this was the deployment of a survey asking about most common technical issues as well as common scenarios that our agents found themselves in.</li>
			<li>After the preliminary survey, pre-canned responses were drafted and sent out in beta form to select group of agents.</li>
			<li>This form led to the further refinement of these responses which were then sent out department wide. Alongside this, a secondary form was drafted to take suggestions for further canned responses as new issues and outages were reported. </li>
		  </ul>
	     <p><strong>Domain Migration Project</strong></p>
		  <ul>
			<li>Responsible for using active directory information to locate numerous machines operating on an old domain. Once identified, coordinated with various department heads to convert these machines over to the new domain within a specific project timeline. Responsible for testing solutions to seamlessly transition devices over without data loss as well as compiling information into a proper knowledge base document.</li>
